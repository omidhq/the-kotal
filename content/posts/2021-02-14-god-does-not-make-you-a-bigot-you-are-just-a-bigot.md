  Sorry! It’s just another gibberish blog post, resembling the other ones.
  Something to me, nothing to you. Meaningful to me, meaningless to you.
  Nonsense! Fiddle-faddle! A piece of crap! But these are irrelevant matters,
  since it comforts me to play with words. Puzzles leads to puzzlement, but it
  still has its own gusto.

Ladies and gentlemen, attend! I am here to make such an important confession. I need your full attention, and then you are urged to remember every aspect of what I am just about to tell you. No. No. Nope! I lied. Sorry! It’s just another gibberish blog post, resembling the other ones. Something to me, nothing to you. Meaningful to me, meaningless to you. Nonsense! Fiddle-faddle! A piece of crap! But these are irrelevant matters since it comforts me to play with words. Puzzles lead to puzzlement, but it still has its own gusto.

I Have lolled in my chair, a cup of coffee placed on my desk (sorry, I lied again. Sadly, I am out of coffee today. It’s tea. Tea! How can I write with tea? ugh!), my laptop on my lap, and I am thinking about God. Well, not the kind of God that you picture. Or, let me see. Actually, it may be, I mean, it could be, exactly the kind of God that you picture. See? Here the perplexity begins. And that hits the spot. Whatever you name it: God, Goddess, or even Godless. Yes, why not? even if you do not believe in God, that’s literally what I am talking about. Ah, I shall stop being limp in my limpid argument that I haven’t even started yet. Okay, here you go:

I am not a Muslim anymore. Actually, I never was; for two reasons. First, being born in a whatsoever religious and faithful family doesn’t devote you a devout to that religion. Secondly, I never practiced my ancestors› religious practices. I did for some time, but it was before I became 15. Mind you, in my forefathers› faith, boys under 15 and girls under 9 are not required to practice Islam, and if they do so, it’s only «desirable.» But after the boy gets 15 or the girl gets 9, it’s a compulsory obligation to perform those practices, especially praying and fasting. I never did. And I am 27.

Now it’s the «why» question’s turn: Hmmm, lemme think! Curiosity, curiosity, and of course curiosity, were the only reasons that I left the religion that I never belonged to. In my vulnerable childhood days, my head was packed with endless questions. And I needed answers. But questioning someone’s faith is not welcomed. I was not welcomed, or let me rephrase, I was not convinced with the answers I used to get for the questions like «where does God come from?» «Why even did he create the universe?» «So if he is powerful, why doesn’t he stop these infidels?» «What if I was born a Jew?» Of course, I was just a child. The more my questions seemed logical to me, the more they were stupid to them. Sometimes my source would lose his/her temper and bingo! That was when I came to know that I hate extremists. I taught myself to think alone about those matters, and never share my very own answers with anyone. So, I never challenged a devout person again. Especially those who do the monkey mocking job. Those who believe in their beliefs only because they were born to do so. It is dangerous to play the game of skepticism with them. It really is.

Let me remind you of something: What I meant by hating the extremists is that I hate them all. No matter which party they belong to. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Atheism, and so forth. If you are an extremist, I have nothing to do with you. Well, I may talk with you, I may smile at you, and I even may hug you, but I don’t want to argue with you about your beliefs and I don’t like you. Period! So maybe I am an extremist too. Yes. I belong to the «don’t associate with religious extremists» doctrine. That’ll work!

I was watching Reza Aslan’s interview with Jon Stewart the other day. I find it quite interesting, especially what Reza Aslan points to at 3:20″ of the video. And I extracted the title of my post from his reasoning.
